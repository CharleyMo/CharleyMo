    " ### 1.1 What is Python\n",
    " \n",
    " Python is a general purpose programming language created in the late 1980s, and named after Monty Python, that's used by thousands of people to do things from testing microchips at Intel, to powering Instagram, to building video games with the PyGame library.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### 1.2 History\n",
    " \n",
    "Python was born in December of 1989, when Guido van Rossum from Netherlands created Python while being on his Christmas break while working for Stichting Mathematisch Centrum. He helped create the ABC programming language in 1986, but wanted to improve on ABC and came up with Python.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### 1.3 What is in a name?\n",
    " \n",
    "Being in an irreverent mood that week of Xmas '89, Van Rossum named \"Python\" after the British TV sketch comedy show \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\".\n",
    " \n",
    " ### 1.4 Most Famous Software Programs Written in Python\n",
    " \n",
    "* YouTube\n",
    "* DropBox\n",
    "* Google\n",
    "* Quora\n",
    "* Instagram\n",

    "## 2. Intro Jupyter Notebook\n",
    " \n",
    " ### 2.1 What is Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### 2.2 History and Name\n",
    "\n",
    "The Notebook interface was added to IPython in December 2011, renamed to Jupyter notebook in 2015 (IPython 4.0 – Jupyter 1.0).\n",
    " \n",
    " ### 2.3 What makes it popular\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ability to re-run portions of a program, rather than the entire thing\n",
    "* Very convenient for experimenting with big datasets\n",
    "* Very easy to explore idea and tests code\n",
    "* Easiness of sharing\n",
    "* Make it easy to work on graphical data, interactive graphs and even SQL results\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " ### 2.4 As preferred interpreter\n",
    " \n",
    "Clearly Jupyter Notebook makes it possible for a live manual during training, and can be used as the preferred Python interpreter and development interface even beyond this context."
